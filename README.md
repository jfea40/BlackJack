# BlackJack
A BlackJack game I made from scratch in java. It is fully functioning besides missing the ability to split a hand when you recieve two cards of the same value. I programmed to an interface in order to keep the code organized, and to be able to interact between classes through the interface. I commented throughout my code so my thought process can be followed.
